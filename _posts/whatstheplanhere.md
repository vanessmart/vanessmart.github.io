# As I asked myself, "what exactly is your plan here?"


What a stupid question, meant to spark the start of a solution we know must be figured out. 

"What exactly is your plan here", a question I've asked myself many times; it hasled to great and stupid things. 

Imagine this.
I'm in my car, hanging off the edge of a cliff. The tilting back and forth and uncertainty of where I'm going has hit the back of my knees some minutes ago now. I am rocking slowly forward and backward, and wondering to myself which one is truly the best option. 

I always felt like I landed in these spots. Kind of as abruptly it would show if it were the start of a movie. That's all the context to be given; it's really the only context that matters.

Now this is all very figurative but the analogies are nothing short of relatable.

As a kid, they ask you what you want to be when you grow up, where you're going to college, and how many kids you would like to have. All of which are nothing but executions meant to add pressure to figure your shit out. Importantly though, they lead you in a dangerous direction: one not decided by you.
